# ifcOWL
This is the repository for managing the buildingSMART ifcOWL ontology. Ontology files are made available in RDF and TTL syntax for the following IFC schema's:

- IFC2X3_Final: http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifcOWL/IFC2X3_Final# (OWL, RDF, TTL)
- IFC2X3_TC1: http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifcOWL/IFC2X3_TC1# (OWL, RDF, TTL)
- IFC4: http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifcOWL/IFC4# (OWL, RDF, TTL)
- IFC4_ADD1: http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifcOWL/IFC4_ADD1# (OWL, RDF, TTL)

The above URI's (e.g. http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifcOWL/IFC2X3_Final#) do not yet resolve to an appropriate online location (not RDF, not HTML). In other words, the above URIs are not properly dereferenceable. The only way to use them properly at the moment, is by downloading them and using them locally. 

The same ontologies are also published under permanent and dereferenceable URIs (at http://w3id.org and at http://openbimstandards.org), so that they are appropriately accessible. These ontologies can be accessed online via a browser and via RDF editors (e.g. Protégé, JENA, Topbraid Composer).
